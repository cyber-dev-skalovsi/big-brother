# Installing as a Linux systemd service

This is useful if you want to run the hub or agent in the background continuously, including after a reboot.

## Install script (recommended)

There are two scripts, one for the hub and one for the agent. You can run either one, or both.

The install script creates a dedicated user for the service (`bigbrother`), downloads the latest release, and installs the service.

If you need to edit the service -- for instance, to change an environment variable -- you can edit the file(s) in `/etc/systemd/system/`. Then reload the systemd daemon and restart the service.

> [!NOTE]
> You need system administrator privileges to run the install script. If you encounter a problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cyber-dev-skalovsi/big-brother/issues/new).

### Hub

Download the script:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyber-dev-skalovsi/big-brother/main/supplemental/scripts/install-hub.sh -o install-hub.sh && chmod +x install-hub.sh
```

#### Install

You may specify a port number with the `-p` flag. The default port is `8090`.

```bash
./install-hub.sh
```

#### Uninstall

```bash
./install-hub.sh -u
```

#### Update

```bash
sudo /opt/bigbrother/bigbrother update && sudo systemctl restart bigbrother-hub
```

### Agent

Download the script:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyber-dev-skalovsi/big-brother/main/supplemental/scripts/install-agent.sh -o install-agent.sh && chmod +x install-agent.sh
```

#### Install

You may optionally include the SSH key and port as arguments. Run `./install-agent.sh -h` for more info.

If specifying your key with `-k`, please make sure to enclose it in quotes.

```bash
./install-agent.sh
```

#### Uninstall

```bash
./install-agent.sh -u
```

#### Update

```bash
sudo /opt/bigbrother-agent/bigbrother-agent update && sudo systemctl restart bigbrother-agent
```
